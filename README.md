<b> Problem Statement: </b>


The NGOs which keep and nurture  animals usually face the issue of not getting people for adoption of these living creatures. The accessibility to get the soul-saviours by traditional method becomes a wholesome act.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

A mobile-platform for the NGOs to unite and display the animals available for adoption with detailed description of the respective ones with added pictures and videos which users can have a look with ease from the comfort of their homes. The users can contact the NGOs through the details provided and visit the organisation to proceed for adoption and legalities.
